If someone literally asked you to write down what you stand for...what
would you put?

## Vision

Each one of us is a one-time occurence. Our DNA has never been seen
before, and it will never be seen again. It stands to reason that, in
consequence of this fact, each one of us has a deeper fate we can choose
to realize, or not. Some path that is particular to each one of us, and
nobody else, that we're meant to be on.

Fate comes with a bad connotation - it means that something will happen
to you no matter what you do. This isn't true. The only way you can know
if you're on this path is if your thoughts, your days, your moments are
resonant.

I love helping people become who they're meant to, in person, over
email, or through the software I write. Especially the software, becuase
then my reach is amplified through technology.

At the end of the day, it boils down to pizza, code, users, and fun, and
complete focus on replacing the things that suck in this world with new
things that are amazing.

That’s what it should be, and that’s all it ever needs to be.

### Deep Empathy & Contribution
Care about deeply understanding other people and introducing delight into
the world from this understanding

### Constantly Refining and Improving Judgment
Unafraid to be wrong, but always forthright and earnest

### Curiosity
Understand the next layer of detail. Transmute suck into wonder.

### Work Only With Good People
No whiners, no jerks, 'A' players only

### High Integrity
Life is the sum of action. Care about reputation, legacy, and map for the last 10 years of my lfie

### Introspection
Be realistic. Achievable. Deliberately recognize the extremely diminishing returns of life, love, and meaning beyond a certain level of financial success, and account for the more ephemeral, harder-to-quantify motivational gauges.
