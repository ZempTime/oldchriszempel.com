I'm a Ruby on Rails developer located out of St. Louis, MO.

Spent 9 months teaching myself to code while working part time at Deweyâ€™s Pizza. Then, I applied to <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a>, and out of over 500 applicants, got one of the top placements and started making software instead of pizza. <a href="http://chriszempel.com/blog">(you can check out my journey here - the 2013 posts)</a>

Three months later, I took over Ruby on Rails development for <a href="https://gianthatworks.com/">Giant Hat,</a> where I worked for two years.

My favorite part of development isn't changing graphics on a page or even necessarily writing code itself. What I love is finding the vision for the application I'm building that's so succinct that when others see it, developers AND users...they can just <i>get it.</i>

I think there's a huge lack of true vision in the world, and love talking with people who have a conviction about what the future looks like.

Also happy to help give some advice on how to get your idea off the ground!
