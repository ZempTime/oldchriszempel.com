        <p class="text-left">I’ve taken two courses on edX. I’ve narrowly failed one, and passed the other.
        I took them alone, hunched over my keyboard in the basement.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Here’s my advice on how to pass this class.</p>

        <p class="text-left">He couldn’t find the words for what he was trying to say, but I knew exactly what he meant. The quality he was talking about was this: an aptitude for growth.</p>
        <p class="text-left">This means that when you run into failure, your response isn’t to quit. A growth-oriented response is to <strong>grow better as a result of having run into failure.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-left">The easiest and quickest way to accomplish this is to create a contingency plan: what will your response be when you run into a certain roadblock?</p>

        <blockquote><p class="text-left"><strong>Watch Lectures Ahead of Time</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p class="text-left">The concepts you'll be learning will take time to sink in. Your brain physically needs rest to consolidate the memories of the information you've learned. </p>
        <p class="text-left">If you walk in to one of the sessions without having watched the videos, you're shooting yourself in the foot.</p>
        <blockquote><p class="text-left"><strong>Finding an Accountability Partner</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p class="text-left">Find one person to pair with. More is better, but have one defined accountability partner. You'll check in with each other to make sure you're both staying on top of the class.</p>
        <blockquote><p class="text-left"><strong>Code With Somebody</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p class="text-left">When two people work on the same code, misunderstandings and clarification happen immediately - not when code doesn't run, or at a later review. Having two eyes on the code tightens this feedback loop.</p>
        <p class="text-left">This is the process of learning. Whether they're way more experienced than you, or brand new...code WITH someone. You'll write better code and arrive at understanding much more quickly.</p>
        <blockquote><p class="text-left"><strong>Debugging Process</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p class="text-left">You're going to run into problems and situations you don't understand. Here's the process I use to move past them and making sure I improve my understanding at every point.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p class="text-left">Set a timer for 5-10 minutes</p></li>
          <li><p class="text-left">Pinpoint the problem. Figure out exactly where in your code the bug is happening.</p></li>
          <li><p class="text-left">Is it a typo? Typos happen. Don't pull your hair out looking for flaws in flawless logic.</p></li>
          <li><p class="text-left">Follow the logic backwards. Understand what's leading up to your bug.</p></li>
          <li><p class="text-left">Now try a fix. Remember to record/write out somewhere what you did.</p></li>
          <li><p class="text-left">Keep trying out & recording fixes until you solve it or the timer goes off.</p></li>
          <li><p class="text-left">If you still haven't gotten it, throw up a post and ask for help. Explain your understanding, what you tried.</p></li>
          <p class="text-left">This way someone will be able to help you understand exactly how to solve your problem. This is much better than saying "x isn't working.</p>
        </ol>
        <blockquote><p class="text-left"><strong>Motivation doesn't work. Use a system.</strong></p></blockquote>
          <p class="text-left">In your mind, you know passing this class is good for you.</p>
          <p class="text-left">BUT you can't lie to your brain. Your brain sees nothing here critical to your survival, even if on a conceptual level you know it is.</p>
          <p class="text-left">Motivation doesn't last forever. If you find you don't have an intrinsic curiosity for this stuff, that's fine - normal even. People don't normally like stuff they're not good at. Your brain can't trudge through the boringness.</p>
          <p class="text-left">It's important that you do. How can you find out if you're passionate about doing this or not before you're even good at it? And the way to eliminate motivation from the equation is by pairing specific tasks with rewards.</p>
          <p class="text-left">Personally, I love sushi. Once a week I'd go get sushi if I'd made sufficient progress, and when I was hunched over my keyboard miserable and alone in my basement, I'd do it for the sushi.</p>
          <p class="text-left">You can do chocolate, sushi, it doesn't matter as long as it's something you love. I'd advise to go buy a bunch of chocolate bars and eat one after you've completed a lesson or taken a big leap and done something constructive, so your brain can't deny this is important.</p>
          <p class="text-left">Select different rewards, and choose different tasks to reward yourself for. Test them, find what works. The scoreboard is right in front of you: your edX scorecard.</p>
          <p class="text-left">It's up to you to make your own future.</p>
