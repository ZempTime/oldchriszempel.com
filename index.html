<h3 class="text-center">Who I Am</h3>
<p class>My biggest strength, the thing I uniquely bring to whatever company, team or project I’m on is just simply that I always try to be honest with myself, and open about that — which allows other people to be, too. This has the added side effect of effectively talking about difficult things.</p>
<p>This happens to be a great fit for examining fundamental assumptions and decision-making in both business and code, and why I suspect I <a href="http://chriszempel.com/2013/10/11/how-i-launched-my-development-career-in-nine-months.html">gravitated to development despite not having the background</a>. I say suspect because, deep down, we all have no clue why we really do the things we do.</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Impact</h3>
<p>Point being, all we can do is approximate from external cues. This means all the customer research and planning in the world is crap until someone gives you cash for your product. This how you can tell if your development is working as the value function it needs to be:</p>
<p class="text-center">$ in -> More $ out</p>
<p>This also means that when you develop, you do so in a bubble until you get sustained user feedback. Then the bubble pops and you're thrust into a chaotic world of feedback, broken assumptions, and new perspectives. The success and impact of your software depends on whether or not you organize all of this into useful insight and feed it back into your application. </p>
<p>And this is absolutely my favorite point in the process.</p>
