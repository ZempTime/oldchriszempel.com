<h1 class="text-center">Great Software is Discovered.</h1>
<p class="text-center">Your goal is to build a product and charge for it. More customers, more revenue, more growth.<p>
<h2 class="text-center">You want impact.</h2>
<p>You, the entrepeneur, have an idea. In a perfect world, you should be able to build it, market it, charge for it, and grow it. But unless you're already technical, modern-day technology is extremely complex, and you'll have to spend large amounts of time focusing on areas that aren't specific to your business. We're not there yet.</p>
<p>The takeaway is simple...</p>
<p>You need a development team you can trust. To build the thing that people really want to use takes intensity, experimentation, and a deep curiosity throughout the process: to figure out where and how to enter the market, to figure out how to make users genuinely better people, to reveal how to any choice that's not you is a liability.</p>
<h2 class="text-center">Magic happens when you work with the right people.</h2>
<p>Developers are the human link in the chain who're closest to the machine, and they <i>will</i> see things differently from their understanding of both people, and computer. The best developers will seek an acute understanding of the bigger picture, the whole context you and your idea fit into.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing the right team will allow you to focus on your business and the value you deliver, not how it gets implemented.</li>
  <li>Choosing the right team will allow you to feed your intuition, insight and dedication into a product that people will <i>love</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the right team will carry you through the frank conversations, the difficult choices, the ambiguity of creating something entirely new and give you access to the <b>results</b> you're really after...</p>
<h3 class="text-center">More customers, more revenue, more growth.</h3>
<p>There are so many opportunities in the world for great, great software, and so few people really striving to build it.</p>
<p>Life is so short, why aspire to anything less?</p>
