On occasion, each of us will have truthful thoughts that burst up into our mind uninvited but not unwelcome. They likely bubble up from the murky computations of our subconscious. These thoughts are preverbal, finding words only once we've swished them around for a moment or two.

I have a hunch these kinds of thoughts are incredibly valuable, because they're the way we come to know ourselves and what we're supposed to be doing. But just as you can't follow a trail through the woods if it's obscured every several steps, how can you hope to see the intuitive trajectory of your own path when you only have scantily scattered points to trace it from?

In order for these to have utility, its not only the thought itself that needs to be captured and pinned down into writing, but also the moment and context of your life that introduced you to it. This is the best way to help introduce yourself later, when you've forgotten who you used to be.

I'll be capturing these occurrences and putting them here where they might be useful for other people instead of wasting away on some page in a journal in my bag. And although I say daily, I actually mean, whenever such a thought comes. Although I do hope this happens every day.

These are written simply for myself.

### 15/2/2016

Every day when I wake up, I don't know what to do. Currently I do contract Rails work, along with the vague but consistent instinct I should invest my time and energy into making a product, instead of exchanging it in small, measured bits to others via consulting.

For a little while now, I've been seeing this fact that I don't know what to do as a problem, an issue, a thing to be addressed. I don't mean in the sense of "what do I need to get done?" but in the more general, easily brushed aside, "What am I doing?" At moments I entertain the thought of getting a regular job so I can adopt the illusion of stability and purpose. If I did that, I could certainly pay off student loans faster, start saving for retirement, and more or less neatly fit into some social fabric or another. But the purpose wouldn't be my own, and this wouldn't get rid of the monster in the closet, just provide ways to shut the door more efficiently.

The big reason I can't is because this isn't where the world is going. Eventually everybody here will work for themselves, as their own brand. This has already started in certain industries, specifically those where the main currency is information, like journalism, where information dissemination is completely departed from the mass production processes that used to dominate it. Even so, the rote, mechanistic tasks of the industrial revolution will be moved off entirely to machines one advancement at a time. The place for people, the place for me, will be alongside computers, tackling problems that only computer-assisted people can grapple with. This is what I think the truth is, and must act upon the basis of.

Then, because this is the first daily thought, the context has to start quite broadly: life. But thinking about life as a whole is too ambiguous to be useful. The best way to navigate a situation is typically some form of these two questions:

1. What is the most scarce?
2. Of these, what cannot be replaced?

To the first question: money, energy, time, opportunity.
To the second: time, and to a degree, energy.

So my problem is, simply stated, I don't know where to put my time and energy. So what constitutes a rich life? A life that's awash in what is scarce, and nonrenewable. And that is exactly what mine is at this moment. It is not some great problem I need to go toil at a job to miss and then to appreciate. I simply need to accept and appreciate now.

I must remind myself of this constantly, until it's in my second nature, to inoculate against the external notions that it's money, or status or possessions which bring actual joy and contentedness. Happiness can only be bought with a well spent life.

So simply, it's time to choose and commit to one proclivity or another.
