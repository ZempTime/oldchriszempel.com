title:  "Software is Modern Rhetoric"

I've built software professionally for about two years now, and I still
don't know its fundamental nature. I've thought about it, in passing,
but never truly struck at the core of it. Once you've really intuited
the core principles of a thing, you can place it in different contexts and
accurately draw conclusions about it. In fact, the future becomes an
inevitability, ultimately obvious with some variance in the muddied eddy
of circumstances in the moment.

A great example is lightning & thunder. How does thunder work? If you know that sound is vibration,
matter is composed of many pieces, elecricity can create heat (like when
you touch a light bulb), and that when a thing gets hot, it
expands, all the necessary information is there for you to understand
how thunder happens. Obviously, when lightning strikes, the air around
it becomes heated very quickly, causing a massive wave of vibrations,
thus producting the noise of thunder that's closely related to lightning.

Why is this important? Because being able to arrive at this vision of
where reality is going is what lets you make decisions about it before and better than anybody else.
It lets you hammer in a goalpost, and work backwards from there.

Being able to rely on this vision, in spite of the rest of the
world, is how you will change it.

## So what is software?

The best way to start is to connect new information with what you
already know. So what else is software most like? You can pick from
anything out of human history. What do you choose?

[Jeff Bezos compared the web to the electricity industry.](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_on_the_next_web_innovation?language=en) This isn't directly software, but an apt and related example of this style of thinking nonetheless. When electricity happened, lots of other things happened as a result.

Maybe it's like the introduction of books. Suddenly, knowledge and
potential capability can spread at a scale never seen before.

But in that case, maybe its like trains - not just knowledge, but people
and stuff can travel farther and faster than ever before. This
fundamental expansion of human capability has happened, repeatedly
throughout history.

Still, software has similarities to many things, but it itself is unlike anything else. And this nuance is the most important. So if there's any friction in the the idea of where it came from, then its not a natural extension of that thing and the metaphor needs to be discarded. Because when you figure out what's obvious, it will be without ceremony. It will simply be suddenly seeing something that's always been there. And that's where the real insights come from.

So what's the thing that's just fucking obvious?

I think software is the natural extension of rhetoric. That's right -
musty old greek orators - that. Think about it.

Software is created by people, for other people, for purposes not intrinsic to the
pursuit itself. You don't make software to make software, you make it to
accomplish something. The only thing software, and the internet, has
ever done is help people talk with other people about specific things.

Before rhetoric decided who would go to war, who would stay, how we would build the constructs by which we live our lives. Software fulfills that same function today on a grander, more subtle scale. How we decide where to put our time, what we pay attention to, who we have access to, how we must live.

Just as rhetoric is aimed at speaking to other people inside human systems, I think software is modern extension of rhetoric. Software is shared thought, spoken commentary on the deeper workflows of our lives. Everything about our world is built and decided on. Everything is made, by us, and so is software.

Code is thought, it is voice and opinion on our world and what to do in it. So what's changed? Software doesn't happen through the human voice. Now it happens by pouring human consciousness through electricity and logic machines. This has led to the expansion of hyperrational, deterministic thinking.

This has led to an interesting illusion, a schism, outlined
fantastically in Avdi Grimm's talk [The Soul of Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgbHzFb1hGw).

## The new costs of speaking

In order to speak, you must be able to think and wield computation. The
costs of learning to speak have greatly increased, although they've
decreased rapidly over the lifespan of the software industry. The costs of learning how to speak,
and the act of speaking are large. To make software means you need to
learn how to code.

To make great software, you need a team of great people all focused on
the same thing over an extended period of time.

Another factor is that software is now tackling bigger and bigger
things.

## You can speak

Before I go any further, I must dispel this notion that I hear over and over:

"I'm not smart enough to be a programmer," or, "I can't learn to code."

Whatever the actual excuse, underlying it in each individual is a fear
that they are fundamentally not good enough.

> Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; but if a thing is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach. - Marcus Aurelius

There is no single, basic building block of computer programming which is beyond your grasp. The hard part is when you need to combine many of these things at the same time, and the volume of the things you need to know.

Programming is a lot like trying to learn how to do fancy tricks juggling a soccer ball with your legs. It feels impossible to do on the first day, but the more you bring your body through the repetitions, the more natural and effortless it becomes. Complexity in programming is much the same except the movements take the shape of mental abstractions, so you can’t easily envision what it is you’re after.

Learning to code is also like chopping down a tree. If you swing over
and over, with effort, at the same spot, chipping away this and that,
then no matter how much you wish, speak, say or talk otherwise,
eventually that tree will fall over. This is because, that is the nature
of the task in which you're engaged.

The thing is, there is no clear cut "tree" to chop down. Often times, EVEN FOR EXPERIENCED, PROVEN, PROFESSIONAL CODERS the perception of the task at hand far exceeds the actual work required to accomplish it, so you must proceed forward, rationally, against your feelings enough times until your body has learned to ignore them.

**Stop worrying about whether you’re good enough - you are.**

What you need to be worried about is whether or not you have the time,
space, and opportunity to go through the work needed to achieve success
in a practical means in your life. There is some degree of natural
ability, some degree nurture, and a huge degree of luck. Chris Boardman

Penguins to Flap Harder?](https://disidealist.wordpress.com/2014/12/05/242/).
