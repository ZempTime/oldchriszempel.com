If you look at every single thing that’s ever been popular on the internet so far
It’s just been okay I’m going to connect you with someone else

software is similar in nature to rhetoric

created by people, for other people, for purposes not intrinsic to the
pursuit itself. you don't make software to make software, you make it to
accomplish something.

From the ideal of a greek orator to now, what has changed? time to
learn to speak through software, time to build, and the nature of
problems being tackled

software is shared though, spoken commentary on the deeper workflows of
our lives

expansion of hyperrational, deterministic thinking
expansion of human consciousness through electricity
