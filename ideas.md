Here, I will collect and publicize the musings that typically reside in
one of the notebooks I carry around.

## Aging

I grew up with a Boston Terrier named Molly. Boston's have a life
expectancy of 13, and Molly is 13. Recently, I had to post this in
company chat:

> the dog I’ve had since childhood wasn’t able to stand up. Her tail’s stopped wagging when I pet her, and she’s been awfully quiet today. I’m gonna spend the night at my parents and work from there tomorrow, because in case this is her last, I want her to know that she’s not alone. Depending on what happens, I may not get much sleep, so if you don’t see me on in the morning I’ll make it up in the evening

As the night went on, while I was taking care of her, I noticed that she
was extremely confused. She couldn't understand why she couldn't walk,
or move. Her mind was young, but her body was old.

This gave me an extremely curious thought. If this dog - driven entirely
by instinct - was given the choice between aging, and not aging, she
would definitely choose not aging.

If we're the product of an evolutionary process, and that's our base
instinct, then why do we age? Why do we die? It might simply be a feature of the evolutionary systems that have gotten us this far, with the benefit being genetic diversity and iteration.

But then - what if the point was to escape that?

Death is a touchy topic. I know death is an accepted reality of life, but maybe this is only because we’ve only ever not had a choice in the matter. Striving to not die - to not age, to live forever - this might sound blasphemous on the surface. But is it really? Is there actually anything more natural than this pursuit? Isn't this what we spend our entire lives doing?

I also wonder if some of the greatest problems that need to be tackled by us as a species over the coming century or two (and in some cases, we are amidst them now) will require so much more accumulated knowledge and have such astronomical levels of complexity compared to everything before that to tackle them, maybe one of the requirements is that we need longer lifespans.

My coworker Bredon had an interesting thought on the matter, too:

> Our inherent short-sightedness as a species is definitely a result of a short lifespan. We can't possibly obtain the collective motivation necessary to do hard things when it is impossible to love our great great great great grandchildren.

Maybe death isn't a constant. Maybe conquering aging is simply the most natural pursuit and first
major step for our species.
